<h1>Lab 01: Search</h1>

## I. The project objectives
Research, implement, and present graph search algorithms

## II. Requirements
+ The project is conducted individually.
+ Deadline and submission method can be found on Moodle.
+ Implement the following graph search algorithms:
    1.  <span style="color:green">Breadth First Search (BFS)</span>
    2. <span style="color:green">Depth First Search (DFS)</span>
    3. <span style="color:green">Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)</span>
    4. <span style="color:green">Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)</span>
    5. <span style="color:green">A*</span>

    Your task is to write the code for the BFS, DFS, UCS, GBFS, and Astar functions that have already been defined in the file <span style="color:red">student_functions.py</span>. Do not modify other functions or files (though you may add new functions or files if necessary).\
    **Note:**
    + Prioritize right branch traversal when weights are equal or weights are not important.
    + With Greedy Best First Search, choosing h = edge weight
    + With A*, h = eclidean_distance(pos[current vertex], pos[Goal])
    + Read the code of the Animations.py</span> file to understand how to color the vertices and edges of the graph.

+ Provide at least 5 test cases and illustrate each test case in the report. Test case example:
    + Input:
    ```
    4 0 
    0 3 7 6 9 0 
    3 0 8 0 3 6 
    5 7 0 4 0 0 
    9 0 8 0 6 0 
    7 2 0 2 0 1 
    0 4 0 0 8 0 
    ```
    + Notes:
        + Starting at node 4 and Goal is node 0.
        + edge[0][1] denotes the edge between node 0 and node 1.
        + 3 is the edge weight of edge[0][1].
        + (0,0) is the pos[0].
        + (1,1) is the pos[1].

### III. Report

+ Content:
    * **Student Information:** Full name, student ID, etc
    * **Completion Level of Each Requirement:** Self-assessment of the project on a scale of 1 to 10.
    * **Presentation of Basic Theories:** Including concepts, complexity, properties, etc., of each implemented algorithm.
    * **Comparison of UCS and A\* Algorithms:** Highlighting the differences between Uniform Cost Search and A*.
    * **Bonus for Additional Search Algorithms:** Extra points if additional search algorithms, beyond the four specified (BFS, DFS, UCS, GBFS, A*), are implemented.  
+ Source Code: Code must have comments and be clearly organized.
+ Videos: Screen recordings for each algorithm applied to a test case. For example, at least four videos (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*) for one test case. Submit via a Google Drive link stored in the file <span style="color:red">Video.txt</span>.

    For example:
    ```
    Test case 1:
    + BFS: link
    + DFS: link
    + ...
    ```


+ Submission requirements:
```

# IV. Assessment
- For each completed algorithm, you will receive 1.5 points for the code and 0.5 points for the report.
- Test cases that are not reported will not be graded.
- Any referenced report/source code must be clearly cited at the end of the report.
- Cheating and plagiarism will receive a grade of 0 for the course.
- Folders submitted that do not meet the requirements will not be graded.
- If you submit late after the deadline, 30% of the points will be deducted. After one day past the deadline, no submissions will be accepted for any reason.
